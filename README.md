MASTER code for "A CHROMOSOMAL CONNECTOME FOR PSYCHIATRIC AND METABOLIC RISK VARIANTS IN ADULT DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS " Espeso-Gil et al.2020 

# risk_loci_interactome
Given any GWAS risk loci (or other purpose loci, LOI=loci of interest) and genomic regions of interest (some chromosomes, segments, chrom3Dbeads, COI=cluster of interest) the utility produces a circos interactome coming from HiC-Pro results and reports also a transcription factor binding ranked list of the LOI+LOIconnectome.
